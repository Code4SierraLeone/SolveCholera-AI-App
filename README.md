# Installation
As the app is not yet released in `Google Play Store`:
- Tap on the file `Jarvis_v*.*.*.apk` to install it
- Some phone will ask you to activate insecure sources as it is not an application from the `Play Store`
- The app is installed !

Please check that you have the `Jarvis-API` plugin.

# Setup
On first launch it will ask you for some parameters:
- URL or IP -> Address of your computer running Jarvis
- Jarvis-API port (`8080` by default)

Then tap on the back arrow to go to the main interface.

# Usage
Tap on the mic to speak, and read or listen Jarvis answer. 
Be sure that multimedia sound is not muted if you want audio playback.

### Pre-requisites

### Creating the task to send them to Jarvis

At this point Tasker should open a menu inviting you to create a task for this event:

* Press the + icon to add an action
* You can use the search to select Get HTTP

	* Server: Port: <jarvis url>: <port of jarvis-api>  (ex: 192.168.1.1:8080, displayed at the start of Jarvis)
